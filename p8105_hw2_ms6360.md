# Problem 1

``` r
NYC_transit = 
  read_csv("./data/NYC_Transit_Subway_Entrance_And_Exit_Data.csv") %>%
  janitor::clean_names() %>%
  select(line, station_name, station_latitude, starts_with('route'), entry, vending, entrance_type, ada) %>% 
  mutate(entry = ifelse(entry == "YES",TRUE,FALSE))
```

    ## Rows: 1868 Columns: 32
    ## ── Column specification ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
    ## Delimiter: ","
    ## chr (22): Division, Line, Station Name, Route1, Route2, Route3, Route4, Rout...
    ## dbl  (8): Station Latitude, Station Longitude, Route8, Route9, Route10, Rout...
    ## lgl  (2): ADA, Free Crossover
    ## 
    ## ℹ Use `spec()` to retrieve the full column specification for this data.
    ## ℹ Specify the column types or set `show_col_types = FALSE` to quiet this message.

-   The dataset contains variables station names, station latitude,
    different routes (1 to 11), entry, vending, entrance times and ADA.

-   There are 18 columns (variables) and 1868 rows (observations).

-   The data is not tidy and can be improved by having routes as cell
    number under a variable called “Routes” instead of having different
    routes as its own variables.

Answer the following questions using these data:

How many distinct stations are there? Note that stations are identified
both by name and by line (e.g. 125th St 8th Avenue; 125st Broadway;
125st Lenox); the `distinct` function may be useful here.

``` r
NYC_transit %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 465 × 2
    ##    line     station_name            
    ##    <chr>    <chr>                   
    ##  1 4 Avenue 25th St                 
    ##  2 4 Avenue 36th St                 
    ##  3 4 Avenue 45th St                 
    ##  4 4 Avenue 53rd St                 
    ##  5 4 Avenue 59th St                 
    ##  6 4 Avenue 77th St                 
    ##  7 4 Avenue 86th St                 
    ##  8 4 Avenue 95th St                 
    ##  9 4 Avenue 9th St                  
    ## 10 4 Avenue Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr
    ## # … with 455 more rows

-   There are 465 distinct stations.

How many stations are ADA compliant?

``` r
NYC_transit %>%
  filter(ada == TRUE) %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%
  distinct
```

    ## # A tibble: 84 × 2
    ##    line            station_name                  
    ##    <chr>           <chr>                         
    ##  1 4 Avenue        Atlantic Av-Barclays Ctr      
    ##  2 4 Avenue        DeKalb Av                     
    ##  3 4 Avenue        Pacific St                    
    ##  4 42nd St Shuttle Grand Central                 
    ##  5 6 Avenue        34th St                       
    ##  6 6 Avenue        47-50th Sts Rockefeller Center
    ##  7 6 Avenue        Church Av                     
    ##  8 63rd Street     21st St                       
    ##  9 63rd Street     Lexington Av                  
    ## 10 63rd Street     Roosevelt Island              
    ## # … with 74 more rows

-   There are 84 stations that are ADA compliant.

What proportion of station entrances / exits without vending allow
entrance?

``` r
NYC_transit %>%
  filter(vending == "NO") %>%
  pull(entry) %>%
  mean
```

    ## [1] 0.3770492

-   0.377 of station entrances without vending allow entrance.

Reformat data so that route number and route name are distinct
variables. How many distinct stations serve the A train? Of the stations
that serve the A train, how many are ADA compliant?

``` r
# change column type from double to character
NYC_transit$route8 <- as.character(NYC_transit$route8)  
NYC_transit$route9 <- as.character(NYC_transit$route9)  
NYC_transit$route10 <- as.character(NYC_transit$route10)  
NYC_transit$route11 <- as.character(NYC_transit$route11)  

NYC_transit %>%
  pivot_longer(
    route1:route11,
    names_to = "route_num",
    values_to = "route") %>%
  filter(route == "A") %>%
  select(line, station_name) %>%
  distinct
```

#fully join datasets
joint_trash_wheel = 
  full_join(trash_wheel, prof_trash_wheel)
```

    ## Joining, by = c("dumpster", "month", "year", "date", "weight_tons",
    ## "volume_cubic_yards", "plastic_bottles", "polystyrene", "cigarette_butts",
    ## "glass_bottles", "grocery_bags", "chip_bags", "sports_balls", "homes_powered",
    ## "name")

For Mr. Trash Wheel dataset, there are 15 columns (variables) and 454
rows (observations). As for Professor Trash Wheel, there are 15 columns
(variables) and 71 rows (observations). Once combined, there are 15
columns (variables) and 525 rows (observations). Variables in this
dataset include dumpster, month, year, date, weight_tons,
volume_cubic_yards, plastic_bottles, polystyrene, cigarette_butts,
glass_bottles, grocery_bags, chip_bags, sports_balls, homes_powered,
name. Within these variables, the weight of trash collected in tons,
number of trash collected (plastic bottles, polystyrene, cigarette
butts, grocery bags, glass bottles, chip bags, and sports balls), and
time of trash collection were detailed.

The total weight of trash collected by Professor Trash Wheel is 135.5.
The total number of sports balls collected by Mr. Trash Wheel in 2020 is
856
